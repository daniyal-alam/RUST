- this will only give the ptr of s1 to s2
1- this way there are now two owners of the same memory location
2- this would lead to freeing the same memory twice, this causes security vulnerabilities. It is called a double free error

is this correct Maam? 

Questions:
- which security vulnerability will there be?
- so it isnt allowed to write let s2 = s1 here? ya we can write but it overtakes ownership? */
